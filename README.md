# Player's Plug 

the place to find the game your looking for at the cheapest possible price

## What is Player's Plug

Player's plug is a responsive database of video game sales made with ReactJS using the Cheapshark and Steam API. Browse a list of the best video game deals available right now across a variety of websites or search for the game of your choosing and find it for the cheapest price available.

## Features

Fully responsive across all browsers and devices
A list of all the best video games currently available that can be filtered by price, steam review rating, or store type
Search for any game and view all currently available deals for that game, a release date and metacritic reviews for the game are also displyed (a trailer as well as description for steam games will be displayed once I configure api calls from steam to satisfy cors)

### Upcoming
I plan to add the steam data back once I get a proxy server up and running
